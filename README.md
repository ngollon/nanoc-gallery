nanoc-gallery
=============

Work in progress
----------------

Currently nothing here works in any way. Do not use it.

When its ready, though, this will be the nanoc configuration I use for my private photo gallery.

Structure
---------

| Directory         | Purpose 
| ----------------- | ------- 
| /content          | Your main nanoc site 
| /content/gallery  | The album structure for the gallery 
| /images/          | The images, in the same structure as /content/gallery 
| /static/          | Some static files |
